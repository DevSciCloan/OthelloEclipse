 Othello board game written with Java

 **Rules**
 ---------
 1. Black always moves first.
2. If a player cannot outflank and flip at least
 one opposing disk, they forfeit their turn and
 their opponent moves again. However,
 if a move is available a player may not forfeit
 their turn.  
 3. A disk may outflank any number of disks in
 one or more rows in any number of
 directions at the same time--horizontally,
 vertically or diagonally. A "row" is defined as
 one or more disks in a continuous straight
 line.  
 4. Players may not skip over their own color
 disk(s) to outflank an opposing disk.  
 5. Disk(s) may only be outflanked as a direct
 result of a move and must fall in the direct
 line of the disk placed down.  
 6. All disks outflanked in any one move must
 be flipped, even if it is to the playerâ€™s
 advantage not to flip them at all.
7. A player who flips a disk that should not
 have been turned may correct the mistake as
 long as the opponent has not made a
 subsequent move. If the opponent has
 already moved, it is too late for a change and
 the disk(s) remain as is.
8. When it is no longer possible for either
 player to move, the game is over. Disks are
 counted and the player with the majority of
 their color showing is the winner.
